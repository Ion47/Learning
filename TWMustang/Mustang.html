          Classic Recreations of Yukon, Oklahoma has been building a variety of
          officially-licensed continuation Mustang Shelby models for the past

          donor car that they strip down, get in perfect shape and add all of the
          bits needed to recreate the original look of the high performance
          models. <br /><br />

          Everything underneath gets a refresh, too, including a coilover
          suspension setup, modern brakes and a new Ford Performance engine.

          Engel says the first 429 will have a 460 cubic-inch V8 with “Boss 9”
          hemispherical heads and electronic fuel injection that’s already putting
          out 700 hp, and they’re not done tuning it yet.

          If you walk into a Ford dealer today, you can pick up a 2018 Mustang
          GT that makes 460 hp, hits 60 mph in 4.4 seconds, and includes an
          optional magnetic suspension for less than $45,000. It will be
          comfortable and refined enough to take on a road trip, while still
          keeping up with the pricier BMW M4 on the track.

          But no matter how good the current car is, there's always going to be
          a certain group of people who wish Ford would simply keep building
          vintage Mustangs. That's where continuation builders such as Classic
          Recreations come in.
        </p>
        <p class="my-5 w-[330px] mx-auto sm:w-[700px]  lg:w-[520px]">
          Classic Recreations has been building officially licensed Shelby
          Mustangs for a while, and according to our friends at AUTOMOBILE,
          they're good. Really good. Recently, CR landed the license to build
          three more classic Mustangs: the 1969-1970 Boss 302, the 1969-1970
          Boss 429, and the 1969-1970 Mach 1. These aren't resto-mods, either.
          Underneath the vintage sheetmetal, you essentially get a brand new
          car.

          factory.” As we soon found out, it was. So What?
          <br><br>
          That engine wasn’t even a dream in any engineers’ eyes in 1969. The deeper we looked, the more it became
          obvious what we were looking at. Jim very skillfully mated the 1969 body to the complete chassis and running
          gear of a 2014 Shelby GT500, complete with the full 2014 interior, accessories, and even fuel filler. And a
          few bug guts in the grille proved he drove it to Carlisle from his home in Parkersburg, West Virginia.
